Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. 
It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. 
Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). 
This tutorial gives enough understanding on Python programming language.
Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language.
It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming.
Pythonâ€™s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and 
rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.
The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). 
Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.
If you are running new version of Python, then you would need to use print statement with parenthesis as 
in print ("Hello, Python!");.
Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space. 
The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable.
The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables.
The operand to the left of the = operator is the name of the variable and the operand to the right of the = operator
is the value stored in the variable.
Python language supports the following types of operators:
    Arithmetic Operators
    Comparison (Relational) Operators
    Assignment Operators
    Logical Operators
    Bitwise Operators
    Membership Operators
    Identity Operators
These operators compare the values on either sides of them and decide the relation among them. 
They are also called Relational operators.
Decision making is anticipation of conditions occurring while execution of the program and specifying 
actions taken according to the conditions.
Decision structures evaluate multiple expressions which produce TRUE or FALSE as outcome.
You need to determine which action to take and which statements to execute if outcome is TRUE or FALSE otherwise.
python also supports the while loop,for loop,nested loops.
The Python language has diversified application in the software development companies such as in gaming, 
web frameworks and applications, language development, prototyping, graphic design applications, etc.
This provides the language a higher plethora over other programming languages used in the industry.
